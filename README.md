## Hi, I'm Arnaud Valette
I’m a software developer interested in the full stack, with a strong preference for low-level and foundational topics. I particularly enjoy working in C, even though I also write a significant amount of TypeScript in practice.

My interests sit at the intersection of systems programming, rendering, programming languages, and mathematics. 


Here, you can find small, self-contained projects I produce on the side (in my free time).

## Examples

- 🎮 doom-notcurses — running Doom inside the terminal using notcurses

- ♟️ checkers-notcurses — a mouse-driven checkers game rendered in the terminal

- λ lambda — a minimal lambda calculus lexer and parser in C

- 🧩 Horn — experiments around logic, structure, and computation

I care about clarity, simple designs, and understanding trade-offs. Most of my projects are driven by curiosity rather than production goals.
