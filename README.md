## Hi, I'm Arnaud Valette
I’m a software developer interested in the full stack, with a strong preference for low-level and foundational topics. I particularly enjoy working in C, even though I also write a significant amount of TypeScript in practice.

My interests sit at the intersection of systems programming, rendering, programming languages, and mathematics. 


Here, you can find small, self-contained projects I produce on the side (in my free time).

## Examples

- 🎮 [doom-notcurses](https://github.com/ArnaudValette/doom-notcurses) — running Doom inside the terminal using notcurses

- ♟️ [checkers-notcurses](https://github.com/ArnaudValette/checkers-notcurses) — a mouse-driven checkers game rendered in the terminal

- λ [lambda](https://github.com/ArnaudValette/lambda) — a minimal lambda calculus lexer and parser in C

- 🧩 [Horn](https://github.com/ArnaudValette/Horn) — experiments around parsing org.

I care about clarity, simple designs, and understanding trade-offs. Most of my projects are driven by curiosity rather than production goals.
